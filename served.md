## Questions

1. 10.2.1 200 OK: The server would respond with code 200 because the request succeeded, which constitutes status code 200.

2. 10.3.2 301 Moved Permanently: The question says that the page no longer exists, which suggests that it did at one point, so code 301 would be appropriate because the page has been moved permanently to /cats.

3. 10.4.2 401 Unauthorized: Indicates that the request could not be completed for the user's credentials, which is accurate because the user needs to be signed in to access /account, which would constitute status code 401.

4. 10.5.2 501 Not Implemented: The server doesn't know how to brew coffee!!
